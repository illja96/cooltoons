            Lois is a hard-working mom who often gets stuck with the crummy graveyard shift at Sheltered Shrubs Hospital, where she&#146;s a Nurse.
            With a no-nonsense approach and a healthy dose of humor, Lois does a great job raising her kids solo.
            Not one to put on airs, Lois sometimes forgets to candy-coat things that are particularly harsh.
            For that reason, she could be accused of mothering with a &quot;tough love&quot; attitude.
            But her kids always know they come first, since their mom&#146;s is always the loudest voice cheering in the audience and the first one grumbling voluntarily for carpool.
            With Lois Foutley, flattery will get you nowhere.
            She prefers brutal honesty with a Diet Soda chaser.
