            Ian Richton has a short attention span and a penchant for European styling products.
            Always coifed yet hard to engage, Ian's privileged upbringing makes him difficult to impress.
            Raised by his single and devilishly handsome father, Ian was taught at a young age to smile at the ladies -- but is probably not the sharpest pencil in the box.
            What he does understand he understands fully, like the unstoppable power of musk-scented cologne.
            Ian is a natural athelete.
