  <h2>PRIVACY POLICY AT COOLTOONS.COM</h2>
  <p>
    KlaskyCsupo.com is a family of websites including klaskycsupo.com, cooltoons.com, tonecasualties.com, and classkeychewpo.com (collectively referred to herein as “KlaskyCsupo.com”).
    KlaskyCsupo.com is the place in cyberspace where fans of Klasky Csupo cartoons and other properties can come to find out more about their favorite Klasky Csupo stars, play games and have their opinions heard.
    KlaskyCsupo.com believes in the power of kids and we urge both kids and their parents to use and enjoy our website.
    While we encourage the interactive nature of online media, we strive to educate parents and kids about how to appropriately safeguard their privacy when traveling on the Web.
    KlaskyCsupo.com is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.
    Our information collection practices are described below.
    We urge kids to check with their parents before entering information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know.
    <br>
  </p>
  <h3>What Information Is Collected?</h3>
  <p>
    At KlaskyCsupo.com, it's our policy to create website content that requires minimum collection of information from our visitors.
    Generally, KlaskyCsupo.com limits our collection of information from kids to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g. screen name, age).
    This information is collected so kids can participate in activities (e.g. post messages, play online games) without giving unnecessary personal information.
    From time to time, however, we may request limited personally identifiable information (e.g. kid's email address and/or email address of parent or third party), as explained below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes or offer other online activities (e.g. electronic artwork).
    KlaskyCsupo.com does not condition a kid's participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.
    <br>
  </p>
  <h3>Contests and Sweepstakes</h3>
  <p>
    KlaskyCsupo.com may occasionally offer contests and sweepstakes, which may be entered online.
    To participate in a contest or sweepstakes, a child is asked to provide his or her first name and email address and the email address of his or her parent.
    We then send the child's parent an email within two business days informing him or her of the child's entry and give the parent the option to have the child's entry deleted.
    All the information collected by KlaskyCsupo.com is securely maintained and used only for the purpose of conducting the contest or sweepstakes.
    Once the contest or sweepstakes if finished, we then delete any personal information collected.
    The information collected in a KlaskyCsupo.com sweepstakes may be passed to a fulfillment house that helps run the contest or sweepstakes.
    These fulfillment houses have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of any information that they receive from KlaskyCsupo.com.
  </p>
  <h3>Unsolicited Submissions</h3>
  <p>
    KlaskyCsupo.com does not knowingly accept unsolicited submissions including, without limitation, submissions of scripts, story lines, articles, fan fiction, characters, drawings, information, suggestions, ideas or concepts.
    KlaskyCsupo.com’s policy is to simply delete any such submission without reading it or forwarding it to other KlaskyCsupo.com staff.
    Therefore, any similarity between an unsolicited submission and any elements in any KlaskyCsupo.com creative work including, without limitation, a film, series, story, title or concept would be purely coincidental.
    <br><br>
    If unsolicited submissions are sent to KlaskyCsupo.com via this Site, however, these submissions become the property of KlaskyCsupo.com and may be used, copied, sublicensed, adapted, transmitted, distributed, publicly performed, published, displayed or deleted as KlaskyCsupo.com sees fit.
    You agree that you are not entitled to any compensation, credit or notice whatsoever and that by sending an unsolicited submission you waive the right to make any claim against KlaskyCsupo.com, its parents or affiliates relating to unsolicited submissions, including, without limitation, unfair competition, breach of implied contract or breach of confidentiality.
  </p>
  <h3>Electronic Artwork Submission</h3>
  <p>
    KlaskyCsupo.com provides kids the opportunity to send electronic artwork featuring Klasky Csupo characters or original artwork.
    In connection with the submission of such original artwork, we will ask kids to print out a release form from the site.
    The child and his or her parent or guardian must sign and return the form to KlaskyCsupo.com with any such submission as a prerequisite to consideration of such creative content.
    <a href="release.html">CLICK HERE for release form</a>.
    We do not require kids to submit personally identifiable information about themselves (other than their first names and ages in some cases) in order to send electronic artwork.
    <br><br>
    All information collected for electronic artwork is used only to identify the person who created and/or sent the artwork to KlaskyCsupo.com, and such information is deleted from our system once the electronic artwork is removed from the site.
    <br>
  </p>
  <h3>Use of Information</h3>
  <p>
    KlaskyCsupo.com uses or may use personally identifiable information that kids provide in order to identify their artwork. KlaskyCsupo.com currently does not disclose to third parties personally identifiable information that kids provide. From time to time however, we may transfer, disclose or share such information with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle and deliver certain online activities (e.g. conducting contests and sweepstakes).
    Such third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
    Additionally, in the event that all or substantially all of the assets relating to KlaskyCsupo.com are transferred or sold to another entity, personally identifiable information submitted to us may be transferred to the acquiring entity.
    Finally, we may also disclose personally identifiable information to third parties when required by law or is pertinent to judicial or government investigations or proceedings, or otherwise necessary to protect our website or the safety of its users.

    At KlaskyCsupo.com, cookies are used to determine the number of unique visitors to our website over a given period and to remember user screen names so that the need for multiple log ins is eliminated.
    We do not store any personal information into cookies nor do we link or combine information collected through cookies to any personal information that kids submit online when participating in our activities.

  </p>
  <h3>Parental Access</h3>
  <p>
    At KlaskyCsupo.com, our goal is to help parents ensure that their kids have a safe and fun online experience.
    That's why we've set up a system by which parents can print out and mail or fax us a signed form that allows them to review any identifiable information collected about their child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of their child's information.
    <a href="access.gif">You can link to the form from here</a>.
    KlaskyCsupo.com takes steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child and to ensure that the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian.
  </p>
  <h3>Security </h3>
  <p>
    KlaskyCsupo.com has taken steps to ensure that personally identifiable information collected in the future is secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers as well as electronic security systems and password protections which guard against unauthorized access.
    <br><br>
    KlaskyCsupo.com provides a "bumper page" when linking from KlaskyCsupo.com to an advertiser's site, which lets kids know they are going to an advertiser's site and reminds them not to give out information online without getting permission from their parents.
    <br><br>
    KlaskyCsupo.com provides links to other websites that may have their own information collection practices.
    KlaskyCsupo.com provides internal "bumper pages" that inform kids that they have linked to another site and instructs them not to give out information online before checking with their parents.
    These other websites are governed by their own privacy policies or information collection practices, which may be substantially different from ours.
