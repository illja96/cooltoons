  <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE FOR COOLTOONS.COM</h2>
  <p>
    This is the legal part of our website.
    It's just so everybody knows the rules for Klasky Csupo on the Web.
    Be sure to get your parents to review and discuss these rules with you:
    <br><br>
    1. All the toys and games here are just for you to play with.
    You can't sell them, give them to anyone, or pretend you made them.
    You can't do anything EXCEPT play with them, unless you ask us first and we say it's OK.
    Kind of like playing with your big sister's toys, right?
    <br><br>
    2. If you see something you don't like, remember that all the stuff on the message boards, or online “slam books” comes straight from other kids, not from someone at KlaskyCsupo.com.
    KlaskyCsupo.com wouldn't tell kids what to say, because kids have minds of their own!
    But if someone sends ugly messages, we'll do our best to take care of it.
    We all want KlaskyCsupo.com to be a good, clean place to hang out.
    <br><br>
    3. If you write something that catches our eye on a message board, we might want to use it on the site.
    By sending in your thoughts, and getting your parent’s permission to do so, you and your parents are telling us it's ok to repeat what you say.
    It's even ok to put it in an advertisement.
    It means we can use it in any way we want, anywhere, until the end of time.
    And wouldn't it be cool if we used something YOU said until the end of time?
    <br><br>
    Remember to ALWAYS check with your parents before you send anything to us.
    After all, they might want it to put on the fridge!
    <br><br>
    Of course, the folks in the legal office upstairs have their own secret code for saying all that.
    Here's their version (also known as The Small Print):
    <br><br>
