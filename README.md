# Cooltoons
Cooltoons web site restoration project.
The goal is to restore full functionality and preserve site in working condition.

Main issues are:
- SWF playback
- expired and missing pages

## Tools used
- [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org) to get old versions of site
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to edit HTML files
- [JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler) to edit SWF files
- [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs) to play SWF files

## Original sites
- [Klaskycsupo website](http://www.klaskycsupo.com)
- [Cooltoons website (original domain)](http://www.cooltoons.com).
Seems to expired long time ago. Was bought and currently on sale
- [Cooltoons website (mirror domain)](http://www.cooltoons2.com).
Seems to be original mirror domain. Registered by the same company and hosted on same IP address as Klaskycsupo website

## Pages status
Legend:
- ✅ restore and in fully working condition including dependent paged and SWF components
- ⚠️ restore partially or some functionality broken/mission
- ❌ not restored at the moment
