- expired and missing pages

## Tools used

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to edit HTML files
- [JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler) to edit SWF files
- [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs) to play SWF files

## Original sites
- [Klaskycsupo website](http://www.klaskycsupo.com)
- [Cooltoons website (original domain)](http://www.cooltoons.com).
