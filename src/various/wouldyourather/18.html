			<p>Lenny - I rather be smart like sam because that way you choose whatever job you want in the future. you can still have friends without being popular. Just be friends smart kids. You education will help you more then friends. Your friends aren't going to give you money in the future for free. With an good job that came from good education you can bring your own money home. Your friends today may not be your friends tomorrow.</p>
