Well get over it, wouldn't you want some adveture in your life?, than looking at some stupid painting and art work when you can just look at it on the internet! Well, that's my answer. I know it may be really long compared to your dinky one, word, answer. But, atleast I'm giving a really good answer, and I hope you change your mind about Paris.
