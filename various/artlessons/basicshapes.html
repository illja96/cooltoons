			Cartoon characters seem so real sometimes that it's easy to forget that all they are are a bunch of shapes put together in a particular way to form a figure.
			Eliza, for example, has two circles for her head, two for her body, and long ovals for her arms, legs and neck.

		<h4>In drawing a character, guidelines are a good way of determining height as well as positioning of each of the basic shapes that make up the form.</h4>

		<h4>Feel free to use as many guidelines as possible in your drawings. Remember: you can always erase them later!</h4>

		<h4>Once you get a bit of practice determining how to break down characters into basic shapes, you will be able to draw almost anything this way!</h4>
